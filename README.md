# Fine-Tuning Language Models with LoRa

This project integrates language models with LoRa (Low Rank Adaptation) technology to perform sentiment analysis.

The goal is to explore how language models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like sentiment analysis while utilizing LoRa technology for efficient, low-power communication. The project emphasizes the potential of combining NLP with communication technologies for real-world applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face `transformers` library
- LoRa module (for communication)
- Other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file


## Usage

- The notebook guides you through the fine-tuning process using the provided dataset.
- It demonstrates how to utilize LoRa technology to transmit sentiment analysis results in a low-power environment.

## Ethical Considerations

Before deploying this in real-world scenarios, careful attention must be paid to:
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the data used for training is anonymized and complies with data protection regulations.
- **Bias in Language Models**: Fine-tuned models should be evaluated for fairness to avoid introducing biases in sentiment analysis.
