# FTLM-with-LoRA
Fine tuning language models 
This scenario demonstrates the potential for fusing state-of-the-art natural language processing with robust communication technologies. It is a conceptual integration of language models with LoRa(Low Rank Adaptation) technology for sentiment analysis. Careful consideration of the particular use case, data privacy, and ethical implications would be necessary for real-world implementation.
